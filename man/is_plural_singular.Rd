\description{
Determines whether two given Spanish words are singular and plural forms of each other. The function evaluates common singular-plural transformations and handles special cases, including words ending in "s" or "x" and irregular plurals.
}
\details{
This function checks if the words are related by common singular-plural transformations. It handles various suffix changes and some irregular pluralization cases:
- Words ending in "s" or "x" are considered to not change their plural form.
- Handles irregular plurals, such as "luz" becoming "luces".
