# sunflower: Classifying Spanish production errors

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of *sunflower* is to handle multiple response data, compute
formal metrics, and classify production errors, whether in speech or
spelling. The outputs of this package make it easy to run statistical
analyses in `R`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sunflower from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ismaelgutier/sunflower")
```

To use *sunflower*, the user will only need to load it in R, we
recommend to work with RStudio.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
require(sunflower)
```
