The goal of *sunflower* is to handle multiple response data, compute formal metrics, and classify production errors, whether in speech or spelling transcriptions. The outputs of this package make it easy to run statistical analyses in [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

Also, make sure you install the tidyverse package to work with pipes.
