Description: 
    A package to study the production quality of Spanish speakers with aphasia. 
    sunflower is a succinct tool that allows for managing multiple responses, 
    computing formal quality measures, and classifying language production errors. 
    It is designed to assist clinicians and researchers with error classification and formal analysis tasks. 
    While the package can compute formal measures on its own, it depends on additional "nutrients," 
    such as word lists from dictionaries or databases and corpora that include word embeddings obtained 
    through natural language processing to classify errors.
