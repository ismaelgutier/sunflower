Description: 
    A package to study the production quality of Spanish speakers with aphasia. 
    This succinct tool provides functions for managing data and obtaining key
    measures for analyzing target-response formal similarity and 
    conduite d'approche behavior in speech or writing samples. 
    Additionally, it includes tools for classical error categorization, 
    offering an easy way to evaluate and understand language production in aphasia.
