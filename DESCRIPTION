Description: 
  sunflower is an R package designed to analyze the production quality of Spanish speakers with aphasia. 
  This tool provides streamlined functionality for managing multiple response attempts, calculating formal quality metrics, and classifying language production errors. 
  It is intended to support clinicians and researchers in error classification and formal analysis tasks. 
  While sunflower can compute formal metrics independently, it relies on additional "nutrients," 
  such as word lists from dictionaries, linguistic databases, and corpora enriched with word embeddings derived from natural language processing techniques, to classify errors.
